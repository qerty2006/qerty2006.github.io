With the fires nearing UCLA last week, I evacuated back home, dreading online classes but content with the idea that now I hove slightly more free time to binge watch Youtube gaming channels. However, since I kept on watching videos by channels by Linus Tech Tips and other technical channels, the almightly Youtube algo threw a curveball straight into my feed and now I got videos of people building full computers from Minecraft redstone. With the image of running Minecraft on a redstone computer ***while*** playing Minecraft firmly ingrained in my head, I wanted to make a post showing off the technical prowness of gamers, displaying the variety of games that you can build a full (but laggy) computer in and a little description of Turing machine and their importance in all of this. 

# GAMES
## Minecraft (obviously)

Minecraft stands out as the quintessential sandbox game for in-game computer creation. Players have built impressive computing systems using redstone, a game element that functions similarly to electrical circuits. These creations range from fully functional 8-bit computers capable of running basic programs to working graphing calculators and even devices that can play simple games like Tetris or Snake. These redstone computers often use thousands of components and can take months to design and build, showcasing the incredible creativity and problem-solving skills of the Minecraft community.

Redstone works a lot like real life signals, having a high and low version of the signal, and there are machines that can read the signal, like lamps (which act like pixels of a display)

If you want to learn more about redstone computing, I cannot recommend anyone more than [Mattbatwings] on Youtube. From [QR code generators] to [basic logic gate explanations], this channel not only showed me how to break servers with computationally complex operations but also gave me the building blocks to understand how regular computer chips work.


## Terraria (aka 2D Minecraft)
## Factorio (Kinetic Computing)
## Why did I mention Turing machines before?
## Magic The Gathering (all hail card games)

# Why should you care?
